# What this?

I just wanted to use [netboot.xyz](https://netboot.xyz) but without needing external internet access. So this builds the [boot.netboot.xyz](https://boot.netboot.xyz) server so that you can run it locally. I have explicitly moved everything to http and not https because I don't want to deal with certificates.
